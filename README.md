# Tic-React-Toe v0.1

A simple tic-tac-toe app created in React, using the tutorial at reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.

For this version, I stopped at the point of "Lifting State Up" and will continue when I have time!

My plan is to complete this app and push it up into IPFS, polish it with a theme, and then push it up into IPFS as a proof of concept.

Built in February 2021 - on the weekends, when I'm not working on defending civil lawsuits.
